After the failed EMP wave, the Mjolnir picked up Bane, who appears to be the only survivor of the battle between the Sentinels and the Zion fleet, but has in fact been taken over by Smith and murdered everyone on the Caduceus. Shortly later they located the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar after their ship is destroyed by a Sentinel tow bomb. Against Captain Roland's better judgment, Niobe lets Neo and Trinity (and a stowed-away Bane) take the Logos in an attempt to reach the Machine City.",
